    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="date-header">
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 21, 2025<br>
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 21, 2025
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you", or "your") and ON Network A.Ş. ("ON Network", "we", "us", or "our") governing your use of the ON Network mobile application ("Application") and all related services, features, content, or websites (collectively, the "Services").</p>
    <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong> BY ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED THEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
    <h3>Age Restriction</h3>
    <p>To use the Services, you must be at least 13 years old (or the age required to enter into a binding contract in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher). If you are younger, you may only use the Services with the permission and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian, in which case your parent or guardian is deemed to accept these Terms.</p>
    <h3>Registration Accuracy</h3>
    <p>When creating an ON Network account ("Account"), you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. It is your responsibility to keep your registration information up to date. Providing false or misleading information may result in the suspension or termination of your Account.</p>
    <h3>One Account Rule</h3>
    <p>Each individual may create and use only one Account. Creating, managing, or using multiple Accounts (including by obscuring identity through proxies, VPNs, or other methods) is strictly prohibited and will result in the immediate termination of all associated accounts and forfeiture of any accumulated ON Coins.</p>
    <h3>Account Security</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account credentials (username and password). You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security. We are not liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your Account's security, but you could be held liable for losses incurred by ON Network or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
    <h3>Prohibited Jurisdictions</h3>
    <p>Use of the Services may be illegal in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to ensure that your use of the Services complies with the laws of your jurisdiction of residence. Use of the Services is prohibited in jurisdictions where it is illegal.</p>

    <h2>3. Description and Use of Services</h2>
    <h3>General Description</h3>
    <p>ON Network is a platform that allows users to accumulate a digital asset called ON Coin ("ON") by periodically interacting with the Application ("Mining Session"). Users can also form teams by inviting other users ("Referral Program") and may earn additional benefits (e.g., temporary Mining Rate increase - "Boost") by viewing advertisements presented within the Application.</p>
    <h3>Mining Sessions</h3>
    <p>To earn ON, you must manually initiate the Mining Session periodically (typically once every 24 hours) as indicated in the Application. The duration and earning mechanism of the session are determined by us and may change. Your active participation between sessions is required; automated participation or bot usage is prohibited.</p>
    <h3>Referral Program</h3>
    <p>You may invite other users to join the Application using your unique invitation code. Each user who successfully joins ("Referral") is added to your team ("Team"). Your active Referrals may increase your ON earning rate according to specific rules. Abuse of the referral program (e.g., creating fake accounts, spamming) is prohibited.</p>
    <h3>Ad-Supported Boost</h3>
    <p>We may offer opportunities to temporarily increase your Mining Rate ("Boost") for a limited time by watching advertisements within the Application. The availability of ads, their duration, and the amount of Boost provided are not guaranteed and may vary. Ads are served by third-party providers, and we are not responsible for their content. We accept no liability if the Boost mechanism fails to function due to technical issues.</p>
    <h3>Marketplace</h3>
    <p>We plan to introduce a platform ("Marketplace") in the future where Users may exchange goods and services with each other using their accumulated ON. The launch, operation, and rules of the Marketplace may be subject to separate terms and conditions, which will be published in addition to these Terms. We do not guarantee when or under what conditions the Marketplace will be launched.</p>
    <h3>Service Modifications and Interruptions</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services, its features, or operation, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice. The Services may experience interruptions due to maintenance, updates, or technical issues. We are not liable for any loss or inconvenience caused by such modifications or interruptions.</p>

    <h2>4. ON Coin: Nature, Value, and Use</h2>
    <h3>Digital Asset</h3>
    <p>ON Coin is a digital asset created and distributed within the ON Network ecosystem. It is designed as a cryptocurrency but does not currently operate on a fully decentralized blockchain (pending the Mainnet phase).</p>
    <h3>Earning Mechanism</h3>
    <p>ON can only be earned through active participation within the Application according to the specified rules (Mining Sessions, Referral Program, Ad Watching, etc.). Earning rates ("Mining Rate") are variable and are dynamically adjusted based on factors such as the total number of users in the network, the size of your active team, and applicable Boost status. These rates may be periodically adjusted by us (e.g., through "halving" events) to manage network growth and ON scarcity. Current rates and the halving schedule are announced within the Application.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <strong>LACK OF VALUE AND SPECULATIVE NATURE: IMPORTANT:</strong>
        <p>ON COIN CURRENTLY HAS NO ESTABLISHED MONETARY VALUE, MARKET PRICE, OR LIQUIDITY IN THE REAL WORLD OR ON ANY DIGITAL ASSET EXCHANGE. IT IS ENTIRELY A SPECULATIVE ASSET. WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT ON WILL HAVE ANY VALUE IN THE FUTURE, BE LISTED ON EXCHANGES, OR BE ACCEPTED AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. EARNING OR HOLDING ON IS NOT A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE DONE WITH THE EXPECTATION OF ANY FINANCIAL RETURN. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FINANCIAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ON NETWORK.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Usage Limitations</h3>
    <p>Currently, ON can only be accumulated within your Account balance in the Application. Potential use cases for ON within the Application ecosystem may emerge if the Marketplace or other features are launched in the future. Transferring, selling, or exchanging ON outside the Application or for other cryptocurrencies is currently not possible and is not guaranteed to become possible in the future.</p>
    <h3>Ownership and Control</h3>
    <p>The ON in your Account balance belongs to you, but this ownership is defined within the framework of the Application and these Terms. We reserve control over the technical infrastructure related to the transfer or use of ON (e.g., a future blockchain or wallet system) and the right to modify or update this infrastructure.</p>
    <h3>Taxation</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for any and all tax liabilities (such as income tax, value-added tax, etc.) associated with your earning or potential future transactions involving ON. It is your obligation to make necessary declarations and pay taxes.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <p>While using the Services, you are strictly prohibited from engaging in the following activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Illegal Use:</strong> Violating any applicable local, state, national, or international law or regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud and Deception:</strong> Providing false, misleading, or deceptive information; impersonating others; attempting to defraud others.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation and Cheating:</strong> Using bots, scripts, emulators, or other unauthorized software to automate the mining process, manipulate earning rates, or gain an unfair advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> Creating or controlling more than one Account for yourself or on behalf of others.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Trading:</strong> Selling, renting, transferring, or otherwise commercializing your Account, ON balance, or invitation code.</li>
        <li><strong>System Interference:</strong> Interfering with, damaging, overburdening, or disrupting the operation of the Services, servers, or networks; attempting to bypass security measures.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Attempting to extract the source code or underlying algorithms of the Application, decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering it.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Mining:</strong> Using automated tools (spiders, scrapers, etc.) to collect data from the Services without our permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Harassment and Abuse:</strong> Harassing, threatening, defaming, disparaging, or violating the privacy of other users; promoting hate speech, discrimination, or illegal content.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Property Infringement:</strong> Infringing upon our copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Malicious Software:</strong> Distributing viruses, Trojan horses, worms, or other harmful or destructive code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Engaging in any of these prohibited activities may result in the immediate suspension or permanent termination of your Account without prior notice, forfeiture of all accumulated ON, and potential legal action.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services and Advertisements</h2>
    <h3>Advertisements</h3>
    <p>To support the free provision of our Services, we may display advertisements through third-party ad networks like Google AdMob. Interacting with these ads (viewing, clicking, etc.) may offer you in-App rewards (like Boosts). The content, accuracy, and appropriateness of these ads are the responsibility of the advertisers. Your interaction with ads is voluntary. Please refer to the documentation of the relevant ad network for their privacy policies and practices.</p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>Our Services may contain links to websites or resources operated by third parties. We provide these links solely for convenience and do not endorse or assume any responsibility for the content, products, or services of such third-party sites. Your use of such third-party sites is at your own risk.</p>

    <h3>ON Network Ownership</h3>
    <p>The Services and their content, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, software, and the ON Coin itself, are the property of ON Network or its licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
    <h3>Limited License</h3>

This license does not permit you to resell or commercially use the Services or their contents; create any derivative works; use data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ON NETWORK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>

    <p>WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE FUTURE VALUE, UTILITY, LIQUIDITY, OR LISTING ON EXCHANGES OF ON COIN.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ON NETWORK, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES; (C) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; AND (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
    <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ON NETWORK ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, OR ONE HUNDRED (100) TURKISH LIRA, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ON Network, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your use of the Services (including engaging in prohibited activities); (c) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or (d) any content you provide. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Services.</p>

    <h2>11. Modification of Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or update these Terms at any time. When we make changes, we will post the revised Terms within the Application or on our website and update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the Terms. Changes become effective upon posting. If we make material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you through additional means, such as email or an in-app notification. Your continued use of the Services after the changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Services.

    <h2>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p>These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Turkey, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such Disputes.</p>
    <p><em>(Alternative - Arbitration Clause could be added here): [Consider adding a clause here for resolving disputes through binding arbitration instead of court, which can often be faster and less costly. This should be drafted with legal counsel.]</em></p>

    <h2>14. General Provisions</h2>
    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the Terms, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <h3>No Waiver</h3>
    <p>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by us.</p>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, or your rights or obligations hereunder, without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer these Terms, and our rights and obligations hereunder, without restriction.</p>
    <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
    <p>We shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside our reasonable control (e.g., acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, civil unrest, internet disruptions, governmental acts).</p>
    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral or written, regarding the Services.</p>
